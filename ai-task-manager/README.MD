# AI-Powered Task Management System

## üìå Overview
The AI-Powered Task Management System is a **full-stack** application designed to help users efficiently manage, prioritize, and analyze their tasks. The system seamlessly integrates **multiple LLM providers** (OpenAI, Claude, Grok (API keys not easily accessible currently - Feb 2025), and Gemini) for AI-powered task assistance while ensuring **secure authentication** with users‚Äô own credentials. The **React + Vite + TypeScript frontend** provides an intuitive user experience, while the **FastAPI backend** handles authentication, task management, and AI integration.

## üöÄ Features
- **Task Management & Scheduling**  
  - Create, edit, and delete tasks with priority and deadline sorting.
  - Multi-select tasks for bulk actions like deletion or AI analysis.
  - Seamless UI with smooth animations and responsive design.
- **AI Integration**  
  - Secure authentication with OpenAI, Claude, and Gemini.
  - LLM-powered task suggestions and enhancements.
  - Rate-limiting and Redis caching for optimized performance.
- **Data Persistence & Performance**  
  - **FastAPI + SQLite** for lightweight storage.
  - **Redis caching** for session management and response optimization.
  - Authentication with OAuth/API keys per LLM provider.

## üèó Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js (Vite, TypeScript, TailwindCSS)
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python), SQLite, Redis
- **LLM Providers**: OpenAI, Claude, Gemini
- **Authentication**: OAuth / API key-based authentication per provider
- **Containerization**: Docker (Planned for deployment optimization)
