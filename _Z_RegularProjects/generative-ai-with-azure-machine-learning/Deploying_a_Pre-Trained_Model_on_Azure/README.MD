## Fine-Tuning T5-Base on Azure for PubMed Summarization

This project demonstrates how to fine-tune a T5-Base model on Azure ML Studio (Azure Foundry) using the PubMed summarization dataset to improve scientific document summarization capabilities.

### Project Overview

The PubMed summarization dataset contains scientific papers with their abstracts, making it ideal for training models to generate concise summaries of complex medical and scientific documents. By fine-tuning the T5-Base model on this specialized dataset, we significantly improve its ability to create accurate and relevant summaries of scientific literature.

### Dataset Details

The PubMed summarization dataset includes:

| Split | Instances | Avg. Article Tokens | Avg. Abstract Tokens |
|-------|-----------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Train | 119,924   | 3,043               | 215                 |
| Validation | 6,633 | 3,111              | 216                 |
| Test  | 6,658     | 3,092               | 219                 |

**Data Fields:**
- `id`: Unique paper identifier
- `article`: Full text of the scientific paper
- `abstract`: Author-written abstract of the paper

### Implementation Steps

#### 1. Azure Resource Setup
- Created an Azure ML Workspace (`pubmed-summarization-ws`)
- Requested VM quota for `Standard_NC8as_T4_v3` (8 cores, 56GB RAM, T4 GPU)
- Deployed Azure Machine Learning Compute Cluster:
  - Min nodes: 1
  - Max nodes: 2
- Set up Azure Blob Storage for dataset storage

#### 2. Dataset Preparation
- Downloaded PubMed summarization dataset from Hugging Face (ccdv/pubmed-summarization)
- Randomly sampled 25,000 training instances to optimize for available vRAM and reduce training time
- Uploaded the processed dataset to Azure Blob Storage (`pubmed-dataset` container)
- Preserved the original validation and test splits for accurate evaluation

#### 3. Model Fine-Tuning
- Loaded the pre-trained `t5-base` model and tokenizer
- Configured training parameters:
  - Training epochs: 3
  - Batch size: 4 (optimized for GPU memory)
  - Learning rate: 5e-5 with linear decay
  - Mixed precision (FP16) for faster training
- Fine-tuned using `run_summarization.py` script on Azure ML Compute
- Training time: ~6 hours on the T4 GPU cluster

#### 4. Evaluation Results

| Metric | Baseline T5-Base | Fine-Tuned T5-Base | Improvement |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| ROUGE-1 | 32.5 | 46.2 | +13.7 |
| ROUGE-2 | 12.8 | 25.7 | +12.9 |
| ROUGE-L | 28.9 | 41.5 | +12.6 |
| BLEU Score | 10.5 | 18.3 | +7.8 |
| Compression Ratio | 0.21 | 0.18 | Better |

**Error Analysis:**
- Common errors in baseline model:
  - Inclusion of irrelevant details
  - Missing key conclusions
  - Factual inaccuracies
- Fine-tuned model improvements:
  - 65% of summaries rated "good" (up from 38% with baseline)
  - Better preservation of key medical terminology
  - More concise summaries with improved factual consistency

#### 5. Model Deployment
- Converted the fine-tuned model to ONNX format for optimized inference
- Deployed as an Azure ML Endpoint (`pubmed-summary-api`)
- Implemented API authentication and request handling
- Created a simple Python client for testing:
```python
import requests

api_url = "fineTuned-model-compute-api-endpoint/score"
api_key = "APIKEY=replace"

headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

response = requests.post(
    api_url,
    headers=headers,
    json={"text": "Long scientific article content..."}
)

summary = response.json()["summary"]
print(summary)
```

### 6. Future Improvements
- Scale up to T5-Large for potentially better summarization quality
- Implement reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to align summaries with expert preferences
- Explore domain-specific vocabulary embeddings for improved medical terminology handling
- Compare with BART model architecture for summarization quality
- Implement batch processing for summarizing multiple papers efficiently
- Rent out more/better compute to accomodate more data yet relatively manageable training times.

## Technical Implementation

The fine-tuning script utilizes Hugging Face Transformers and Azure ML to train the model:

```python
# Sample training code
from transformers import T5Tokenizer, T5ForConditionalGeneration, Trainer, TrainingArguments

# Load model and tokenizer
model_name = "t5-base"
tokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Configure training arguments
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="./t5_pubmed",
    evaluation_strategy="epoch",
    save_strategy="epoch",
    per_device_train_batch_size=4,
    per_device_eval_batch_size=4,
    num_train_epochs=3,
    learning_rate=5e-5,
    warmup_steps=500,
    weight_decay=0.01,
    logging_steps=500,
    save_total_limit=2,
    fp16=True,
    report_to="azureml"
)
```

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of fine-tuning T5-Base on Azure for scientific document summarization. The fine-tuned model showed significant improvements across all evaluation metrics compared to the base model. By leveraging Azure ML's scalable compute resources and deployment capabilities, we were able to create a production-ready summarization API that can process complex scientific documents with improved accuracy and relevance while optmizing for time and cost.
