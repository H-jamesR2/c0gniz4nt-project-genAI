According to ChatGPT and Gemini, developing an NLP solution in a Python notebook on **Google Colab** would be considered a **cloud-based NLP solution**.

Here's why:


```txt
- Google Colab is a cloud-based service that provides you with a virtual environment to run Python code, including for tasks like NLP. When you use Google Colab, your code is executed on Google's cloud infrastructure rather than on your local machine.
  
- It provides access to powerful computational resources like GPUs and TPUs, which can be useful for training large machine learning models, including those for NLP.

- Since youâ€™re using Colab, your code, datasets, and results are stored in the cloud (Google Drive), and you can easily access your environment from any device with internet connectivity.

So while Google Colab is often used as a tool for experimentation and development, it enables you to build and run your NLP models in a cloud environment, making it a cloud-based solution for NLP development. However, in a production setting, if you were deploying an NLP model or API, you might opt for other cloud platforms like Google Cloud, AWS, or Azure to scale your solution further.

REPORT:
1. Task Definition
    - Objective: The objective of this task is to build a sentiment analysis model using transformer architecture to classify Amazon reviews into positive or negative sentiments based on star ratings.
    - Significance: Sentiment analysis is crucial for businesses to understand customer opinions, improve products, and enhance customer service. This task could be applied in various customer-facing applications such as automated review classification, feedback systems, and social media monitoring.

2. Dataset Insights
    - Dataset: The dataset consists of Amazon product reviews with corresponding star ratings. The reviews are classified into two categories: positive (4-5 stars) and negative (1-2 stars).
    - Data Preprocessing:
    -- Removal of neutral sentiment (3-star reviews).
    -- Text cleaning: Removal of non-essential characters, formatting, and handling language discrepancies.
    -- Text formatting: Tokenization and padding for model input.

3. Training Summary
    - Model Choice: Fine-tuned a transformer model (e.g., distilbert-base-uncased) on the sentiment analysis task.
    #### Hyperparameters:
    - Learning rate: 2e-5
    - Epochs: 3
    - Batch size: 16
    - Weight decay: 0.01
    - Optimizer: AdamW
    #### Training Procedure:
    - The model was fine-tuned using the Kaggle Amazon review dataset.
    - Sentiment labels were pre-processed and mapped to 0 (negative) and 1 (positive).

4. Evaluation Results
    - Sentiment Accuracy: The model achieved a sentiment accuracy of 0.9425 on the test dataset.
    - Analysis: The model performs well, showing consistent accuracy. However, there is room for improvement in handling reviews with more subtle language or mixed sentiments.

5. Future Improvements
- Model Improvement: Experiment with larger transformer models (e.g., BERT or GPT-2) for better understanding of context.
- Handling Neutral Sentiment: Reintroduce 3-star reviews to better handle neutral sentiments for more nuanced analysis.
- Data Augmentation: Use techniques like back-translation or paraphrasing to increase dataset size.
- Data Size: Use more of the dataset (unfortunately had to sample 1/10 for train and test data as my compute instance kept crashing as it was running out of memory)
- Compute Resources: Use more compute resources to train better models.
- Optimization: Try more advanced techniques like model distillation for faster inference or applying quantization for deployment.
