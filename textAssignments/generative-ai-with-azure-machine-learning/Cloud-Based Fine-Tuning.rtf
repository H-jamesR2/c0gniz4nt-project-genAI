Which of the following tools optimizes model deployment in Azure?
A) ONNX Runtime (Correct Answer)


--- Application Task: Three Potential Tasks for Fine-Tuning

---- 1. Medical Report Analysis
- Pre-trained Model Choice: BioBERT
- Benefits of Fine-Tuning: 
    BioBERT is already pre-trained on biomedical literature, making it an excellent foundation for medical domain tasks. 
    Fine-tuning allows the model to adapt to specific medical terminologies, report structures, and institutional documentation 
    styles without losing the general medical knowledge embedded in the base model. This approach significantly reduces the amount of training data 
    needed compared to training from scratch, which is particularly valuable in healthcare where annotated data may be limited due to privacy concerns. 
    Fine-tuning also enables the model to understand context-specific medical abbreviations and specialized vocabulary that might differ across medical specialties.

---- 2. Financial Document Classification
- Pre-trained Model Choice: RoBERTa
- Benefits of Fine-Tuning: 
    RoBERTa's robust pre-training makes it ideal for financial text analysis where precision is critical. 
    Fine-tuning this model for financial document classification allows it to recognize specialized financial terminology, 
    regulatory language, and document structures specific to different financial instruments (prospectuses, annual reports, risk disclosures). 
    The fine-tuning process can help the model understand nuanced differences between financial document types that might appear similar to general language models. 
    Additionally, the model can be trained to identify critical information within financial documents while maintaining compliance with regulatory requirements, 
    something that would be extremely data-intensive to teach from scratch.

---- 3. Multilingual Customer Support Intent Recognition
- Pre-trained Model Choice: XLM-RoBERTa
- Benefits of Fine-Tuning: 
    XLM-RoBERTa is pre-trained on 100 languages, providing an excellent starting point for global enterprises. 
    Fine-tuning this model for customer support intent recognition allows a single model to identify customer intents across multiple languages with relatively small amounts of training data per language. 
    This approach is particularly beneficial as it enables transfer learning between languages, where patterns learned in data-rich languages can benefit intent recognition in languages with fewer training examples. 
    Fine-tuning also allows the model to adapt to company-specific terminology, product names, and support workflows that wouldn't be present in the general pre-training corpus.

-- Part 2: Implementing Fine-Tuning on Azure
--- Case Study Activity: Cost-Effective Technical Document Summarization
    Dataset Description and Preparation:
    For this project, I would fine-tune a compact, efficient model from Azure AI Studio's catalog to automatically generate concise summaries of technical documentation,
    helping users quickly grasp key information without reading lengthy documents. This approach focuses on practical results with minimal training costs:
    - Source Data Collection:
        Leverage existing pairs of technical documents and their executive summaries from company archives
        Use 2,000-3,000 document-summary pairs maximum (balancing quality and training costs)
        Focus on documents of similar length and complexity to ensure consistent results
        Include a mix of document types (user manuals, technical specifications, procedure guides) relevant to the business
    - Data Preparation Steps:
        Extract full documents and their corresponding human-written summaries
        Clean and standardize formatting (remove headers, footers, page numbers)
        Filter to include only documents with high-quality, professionally written summaries
        Truncate very long documents to a manageable length (first 1,024 tokens) to reduce training costs
        Ensure summaries are concise (typically 100-200 tokens) to help the model learn appropriate brevity
    - Data Formatting:
        Format as input/output pairs: technical document → summary
        Split into 80% training, 20% validation (optimizing for cost efficiency)
        Include simple instruction prefixes like "Summarize the following technical document:"
        Apply basic text cleaning without computationally expensive preprocessing
        Structure the data according to Azure's fine-tuning templates
    - Cost-Saving Strategies:
        Begin with a pilot test using 500 examples to validate the approach
        Use T5-small or BART-base models instead of larger variants
        Configure low-cost compute options in Azure
        Limit the maximum number of training epochs (3-5) to prevent overfitting and control costs
        Focus fine-tuning on only the final layers of the model to reduce computational requirements



Performance Evaluation Reflection (200 words)
After fine-tuning my document summarization model, I would evaluate its performance using practical metrics that balance quality assessment with cost considerations.

I would primarily rely on ROUGE scores (particularly ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L) to measure overlap between generated summaries and human references. 
These metrics efficiently assess content coverage and conciseness without requiring expensive human evaluation for every summary. For a more semantic understanding of quality, 
I would calculate BERTScore on a smaller subset of examples, providing insight into meaning preservation while managing computational costs.

Beyond automated metrics, I would conduct limited human evaluation on approximately 50-100 randomly selected summaries, focusing on practical aspects: factual correctness, inclusion of key information, and usefulness to the target audience. 
This targeted approach provides crucial qualitative insights without the expense of comprehensive human review.

The main challenges I anticipate include handling highly technical terminology consistently and generating appropriately concise summaries for documents of varying lengths. 
To address these challenges cost-effectively, I would implement post-processing rules to handle technical terms and adjust summary length expectations based on input document size.

This evaluation approach provides sufficient confidence in model quality while maintaining budget discipline. 
Rather than pursuing marginal improvements through expensive optimization, I would focus on confirming the model meets practical business needs: 
reducing document review time by 70-80% while accurately capturing key information for technical teams.

-- Part 3: Evaluating and Deploying Models

--- Reflection Activity: Importance of Evaluation Metrics (200 words)

Thorough evaluation of fine-tuned models using metrics like F1-Score and cross-validation is not merely a technical step but a critical safeguard ensuring model reliability and trustworthiness in production environments. 
F1-Score's balanced consideration of precision and recall is particularly valuable for applications where both false positives and false negatives carry significant consequences—such as in medical diagnosis assistance, 
where missing a condition (false negative) or incorrectly flagging a healthy patient (false positive) can both lead to harmful outcomes.

Cross-validation's systematic approach to testing model performance across different data subsets reveals potentially dangerous blindspots and biases that might remain hidden with simpler evaluation methods. 
This is especially crucial when fine-tuning foundation models, as their impressive overall performance can mask serious weaknesses in specific scenarios or with particular population subgroups.

Poor evaluation practices can lead to catastrophic outcomes in production. 
For instance, a sentiment analysis model deployed without proper evaluation might perform well on general text but systematically misclassify culturally-specific expressions of dissatisfaction, 
leading to missed customer service opportunities. Similarly, a document classification model might achieve high overall accuracy while completely failing on certain document types, 
resulting in critical information being incorrectly routed or ignored. These pitfalls emphasize why rigorous, multi-faceted evaluation isn't optional but essential for responsible AI deployment.
