Repo for c0gnizant notes + preliminary project

## Overview:

Built + Trained + Fine-Tune Machine Learning models using Azure AI Foundry Resources and Google Collab using rented compute (CPUs + GPUs) resources. Delved into chatbot training, documment-summarization, sentiment-analysis, Text-to-Image, Image-to-Image, NLP, GANs, Transformers. Utilized served AI models (fine-tuned & base) + their Azure endpoints and conducted testing on Google Collab (for compute) to conduct inference on test data in order to conduct performance reports (based on various metrics [ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L, BLEU Score, BERTScore, Compression Ratio], [Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score]).
