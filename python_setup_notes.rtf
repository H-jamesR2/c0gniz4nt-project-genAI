Tools and Environment Setup
Simple Steps for Setting Up an ML Environment
1. Choose a Programming Language
    Python: The most recommended language for ML due to its ease of use and vast ecosystem.
2. Install Python
    Install Python 3.8 or higher from the official Python websiteLinks to an external site..
    Ensure Python is added to the system path during installation.
3. Set Up a Virtual Environment
    A virtual environment allows you to manage project-specific dependencies without affecting your global system setup. 
    This ensures each ML project is isolated and conflict-free.
4. Install a Package Manager
    Use pip (comes with Python) to install libraries for your ML projects.
5. Install Essential ML Libraries
    For Data Handling:
        NumPy: For numerical computations.
        Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
    For Visualization:
        Matplotlib: For creating basic plots.
        Seaborn: For advanced statistical plots.
    For Machine Learning:
        Scikit-learn: For traditional machine learning algorithms and tools.

These libraries form the foundational toolkit for ML beginners and allow you to handle data, create visualizations, and implement basic ML algorithms.
